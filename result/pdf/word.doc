Aim: Design a SWH system and assess the annual energy saved for a varying
water demand of 50 1/day to 300 1/day (interval of 50 I) for a single collector costing
Rs. 160000 (2000$) for location as discussed during the session. Calculate the LCOE
and Capacity factor for varying water demand and plot the results (w.r.t. varying
water demand). Working fluid is water. Discuss the trends of LCOE, Capacity factor
and annual energy saved as a function of water demand. Also, compare how these
performance indexes change when the number of collector is increased to 2 (for
water demand = 300 1/day). Attach the screenshots of each step in your report and
present a good discussion of the results.
Select the Solar Water Heating and then select LCOE

Solar Resource Library-
The Solar Resource library is a list of weather files on your computer. Choose a file from the library and verify the weather data information below.
The default library comes with only a few weather files to help you get started. Use the download tools below to build a library of locations you frequently model. Once you build
your library, it is available for all of your work in SAM.

The fixed-charge rate method of calculating the levelized cost of energy simplifies time-dependent calculations and is appropriate for market-level analysis
such as for the NREL Annual Technology Baseline, or for very preliminary project analysis. The cash flow method of SAM's other financial models is more
suitable for more detailed project analysis. See Help for details.

The fixed-charge rate method of calculating the levelized cost of energy simplifies time-dependent calculations and is appropriate for market-level analysis
such as for the NREL Annual Technology Baseline, or for very preliminary project analysis. The cash flow method of SAM's other financial models is more
suitable for more detailed project analysis. See Help for details.

-0.0493461Discussion and Description in Brief
The Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE), Capacity Factor, and Annual Energy
Saved are key performance indicators in solar thermal systems. The trend of
these parameters is dependent on the water demand of the system.
LCOE is the total cost of producing energy over the system's lifetime, divided
by the total energy produced. As water demand increases, the LCOE
decreases due to economies of scale. This is because larger systems can
produce more energy at a lower cost per unit, leading to a lower LCOE.
Capacity factor is the ratio of actual energy produced by the system to the
maximum possible energy production if the system were running at full
capacity all the time. As water demand increases, the capacity factor
typically decreases due to the system's inability to operate at full capacity for
extended periods. This is because the system's energy production is
dependent on the availability of sunlight, which can be limited in areas with
high water demand.
Annual Energy Saved is the total amount of energy produced by the system
over a year. As water demand increases, the annual energy saved increases
due to the increased use of the system.
If the number of collectors is increased to 2 for a water demand of 300 1/day,
the LCOE will decrease further due to increased energy production, while the
capacity factor may increase due to the redundancy of having two collectors.
The annual energy saved will also increase as the system will be able to
produce more energy with two collectors instead of one. However, it is
important to note that the increased cost of adding an additional collector
may impact the overall LCOE.
30Conclusion
Based on the trends discussed above, it is clear that solar thermal
systems can be a practical and cost-effective solution for meeting
water demand in areas with abundant sunlight. As water demand
increases, larger systems with multiple collectors may be
necessary to meet the demand and improve system performance.
However, it is important to carefully consider the cost-benefit
analysis of adding additional collectors as the cost of the system
may increase as well. Overall, solar thermal systems are a
promising technology for meeting water demand sustainably and
cost-effectively in areas with sufficient sunlight.
